# MAM (Mobile Attendance Monitoring)

MAM uses RFID / Smart Card technology paired with a node.js backend to record and monitor the attendance of students.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to make the process of monitoring attendance simpler
for all parties involved. Currently attendance to labs can be monitored by
swiping a student card to sign in to the session; the same is not true for
lectures.

Attendance to lectures is currently monitored using a traditional
paper based sign in sheet. While effective this system does not allow for easy
manipulation of data and does not provide any sort of analysis of a session.

Lectures could use the same wired swipe in system as the labs do, however this
would be a hassle to implement and rather costly. A simple solution to this
would be to have a mobile, connected swipe-in system that a lecturer could carry
with them.

The lecturer could then place this at the front of a lecture theatre
and allow all students in attendance to swipe in using their student ID cards.
When swiped the student number from the card would be stored for access by the
lecturer at a later date.
